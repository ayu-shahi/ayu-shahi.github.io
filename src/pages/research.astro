          This study examines the impact of gender norms and work-family policies on the motherhood penalty across a large sample of developing countries. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, I find that regressive cultural norms about the appropriate role of women--- shaped by ancestral adoption of the plough--- significantly reduce women's labour force participation (consistent with Alesina et al. 2013). I show that these effects, robust to an instrumental variable analysis, are pronounced for women of childbearing age, mothers, and estimates of the motherhood penalty. I also run a staggered Difference-in-Difference to assess whether implementation of gender-equal laws can attenuate this penalty. My results provide mixed evidence to this end: while broader institutional shifts towards equality have limited impact, targeted work-family policies like provision of paid maternity leave can have significant positive effects on women's employment in the long run. Overall, my work has important implications for policymakers solving for the gender gap in employment in developing countries, and the persisting influence of cultural factors therein.

          The introduction of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in 2016 transformed the digital payments landscape in India. We utilize district-level variation in UPI adoption through differential timings of district `lead banks' joining the UPI platform to study the effects of digital payments on crime. We employ a Difference-in-Difference strategy to test our hypothesis that UPI adoption is negatively associated with the incidence of economic crimes such as robbery and burglary. We explain our hypothesis through the channels of decreased cash availability and an income effect. Our results show that treatment districts which adopted UPI earlier experienced lower economic crime but had no difference in non-economic crime compared to their control counterparts. Robustness tests which restrict our sample to districts with higher mobile ownership show an even greater decrease in crime, providing support for hypothesized channels. Our research contributes to the literature examining the social and developmental consequences of financial inclusion and digital payments.

          Absence of biological parents is expected to negatively impact their orphaned children's health outcomes through channels of depressed household incomes and lack of parental care and support. Our research study explores this hypothesis by engaging in a comparative analysis of health outcomes of Paternal orphans, Maternal orphans and Double orphans (as classified by UNICEF) relative to non-orphans in India. Using data from Round 5 of the National Family Health Survey, we explore whether there are differences in indicators of stunting, wasting, malnutrition and years of schooling across these three types of orphans. Our paper engages a causal framework by restricting our sample to "blended" households, those with both orphans and non-orphans, and controlling for household-fixed effects. We observe that at large, orphans are at a disadvantage relative to non-orphans, the effects being confounded by poverty and other household characteristics. Their living arrangements are also significant and we observe that Double orphans fare better than Maternal, Paternal and non-orphans in certain settings, pointing towards compensating factors like robust extended familial ties.

        Ctrl+Aid+Delete: Regime-Contingent Effects of Foreign Aid on Internet Freedom

          Across the world, authoritarian regimes have responded to the internet's rise as a prominent channel for political discourse through censorship and restricting access. Simultaneously, developments in the foreign aid space have led to a sharp rise in the amounts disbursed for building internet infrastructure and promoting "internet freedom" in countries where the two are most lacking. Since most aid is directed through recipient country governments, I hypothesize that internet aid leads to improved "government capacity" to control the internet (irrespective of whether they actually exercise this power) across regime type but authoritarian countries leverage this increased capacity to stifle internet freedom. My empirical results provide limited evidence for either increased capacity or freedom and thus contribute to broader debates about the efficacy (or rather inefficacy) of aid in improving democratic outcomes in recipient countries.
