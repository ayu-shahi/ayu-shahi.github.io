        This paper documents variation in social norms concerning caste and gender across
        India and examines their relationship with economic opportunity. Using survey data
        and administrative records, I investigate how these norms shape labor market outcomes
        and intergenerational mobility. The findings suggest significant heterogeneity in
        social attitudes across regions, which correlates with differences in economic
        participation and occupational choice.

        This project examines the determinants of social mobility in developing economies,
        focusing on the role of labor market institutions and access to economic opportunity.
        The research combines household survey data with administrative records to trace
        intergenerational outcomes and identify barriers to upward mobility.
